<!-- Activities
Now let's make our content a little more interesting.

Add some links to your page. Make sure you link to both external pages and internal pages (if you only have a single page then just link to itself)
Create a link to an email address. Include a default subject and body in the link.
Add an id to an item at the very top of your page. Now create a link at the bottom of your page which you can click to take you back to the top of the page.
Add a title attribute to various elements within your document. Try adding one to a heading and a paragraph. -->
